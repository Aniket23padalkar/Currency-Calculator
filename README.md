## Description

This is my first project using an API. I learned how to fetch data from an external API and display it dynamically on the website. One of the key takeaways was understanding the power of **template literals**, which allowed me to directly plug values into API endpoints and work with real-time data efficiently.

## Tech Stack

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features

-   Dynamic country flag updates based on selected currency
-   Real-time currency conversion using API calls
-   Implemented **async/await** for cleaner asynchronous code
-   Basic error handling for failed API responses
-   Reusable logic for updating data with template literals

## Final Thoughts

This project was a great learning experience. I rewrote it multiple times to improve both the logic and structure. Gaining hands-on experience with APIs and template literals has been eye-opening, and I now see how powerful they are in building real-world projects.
